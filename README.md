## Project Overview
This project is developed to streamline GlobalTech Solutions' ServiceNow access by limiting modules and applications to only those relevant to each user's role. This tailored approach reduces unnecessary features, making it easier for employees to find and use the tools they need.

## Objectives
1. *Enhance Efficiency*: Improve operational efficiency by ensuring that users have quick access to the tools and data specific to their role.
2. *Improve User Experience*: Provide a cleaner and more intuitive user interface by reducing non-relevant modules.
3. *Secure Data Access*: Improve data management and access security through controlled, role-specific permissions.

## Key Features
- *Role-Based Access Control*: Assigns applications and modules based on user roles (e.g., HR, Finance, IT).
- *Custom Dashboard for Each Role*: Each user sees a tailored dashboard specific to their function within the company.
- *Data Security*: Ensures that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data.

## Solution Design
1. *Requirement Gathering*: Identify key user roles and their specific access requirements.
2. *Data Model*: Create a data model in ServiceNow mapping roles to specific modules.
3. *Interface Customization*: Design custom views for each role, displaying only relevant tools and information.
4. *Access Logic Implementation*: Implement role-based access rules to control module visibility.
5. *Documentation*: Document each step with screenshots and explanations.

## Testing and Validation
- *Unit Testing*: Each role-specific access control is tested individually.
- *User Interface Testing*: Ensure the dashboard displays correctly for different roles.
- *Integration Testing*: Verify that role-based access works seamlessly with other ServiceNow functions.

## Scenarios
- *Scenario 1*: An HR employee logs in and sees only HR-related modules.
- *Scenario 2*: A finance user has access only to financial reports and budget tools.
- *Scenario 3*: An IT support user can access incident management and support tools only.

## Conclusion
This project provides a streamlined, role-based access control system within ServiceNow. By enhancing user experience and focusing on role-specific needs, it has improved GlobalTech Solutions' operational efficiency and data security.
